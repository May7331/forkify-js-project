Its **integration with an API** enables users to search for over a million recipes using various [search queries](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/phrases.html), making it easy to find the perfect recipe. Additionally, the ability to **bookmark recipes** and **upload custom recipes** offers users a personalized experience.

The feature of being able to **adjust ingredient amounts** according to the number of servings is very convenient as it saves users the hassle of having to perform manual calculations.
